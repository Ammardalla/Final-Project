        <p>when i was younger i had an obsessions on computer and gamming,
             so i spend a lot of my time play computer games and finish them in no time.</p>
         <p>i was so surprised in the game experience and how much i am having fun playing with this games and go throw the game story </p>   
          <p>but my advice to the young don't spend all your time in playing games focus on your dream but some fun never hurt .  </p>
